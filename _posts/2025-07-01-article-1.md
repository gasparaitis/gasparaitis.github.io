The finished template is hosted using the "[Creating a template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)" feature on my GitHub: [gasparaitis/android-app-template](https://github.com/gasparaitis/android-app-template).

## Why use a template?
Juggling many different Android side projects can become a hassle. The solution is to set up a template to make this process easier.
Using a template, you can deploy a greenfield Android app starter with a single click.
To make things simpler, you can choose using an already created open-source template, but implementing your own template is the ultimate solution.

## How to find up-to-date open-source templates?
You can find endless repositories of Android app templates hosted on GitHub. A way to filter them is using the *Advanced search* feature.
I found it excellent to filter old and unpopular repositories by:
1. Selecting *Repositories* inside GitHub Search
2. Adding the *Date pushed* to the query (`pushed` keyword)
  1.  `Android template pushed:>2025-01-01` (Find repositories with text *Android template* that have been pushed to in 2025)
3. Selecting "*Sort by: ***Most stars**"

This is [the URL to my query](https://github.com/search?q=Android+template+pushed%3A%3E2025-01-01+&type=repositories).

## Open-source templates
It's much easier to build upon open-source code instead of implementing it from scratch (no stealing, of course).
Luckily, there are quite many great templates that are available. Official templates made by the Android & Kotlin teams exist. There are also many great community templates.
Here is a checklist before choosing a project to build upon:
- Native Android template?
  - [Official: android/architecture-templates](https://github.com/android/architecture-templates/tree/multimodule)
  - [Amazing template by Kotlin GDE: cortinico/kotlin-android-template](https://github.com/cortinico/kotlin-android-template) (My main inspiration.)
    - [Fork that uses `build-logic`: rhenwinch/compose-app-template](https://github.com/rhenwinch/compose-app-template)
  - [Popular opinionated template: Drjacky/MVVMTemplate](https://github.com/Drjacky/MVVMTemplate)
- Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) template with Native UI?
  - [Official: Kotlin/KMP-App-Template-Native](https://github.com/Kotlin/KMP-App-Template-Native)
  - [Decompose, MVI, SKIE: futuredapp/kmp-futured-template](https://github.com/futuredapp/kmp-futured-template)
- Compose Multiplatform (CMP) template with Shared UI?
  - [Official: Kotlin/KMP-App-Template](https://github.com/Kotlin/KMP-App-Template)
  - [Common screens & libraries: MultiplatformKickstarter/Adoptme](https://github.com/MultiplatformKickstarter/Adoptme)
  - [Common screens & libraries: openMF/kmp-project-template](https://github.com/openMF/kmp-project-template)

## Why create your own template?
Open-source public templates have a high chance of *being left unmaintained*. The reason being that the app starter template must be maintained *constantly* to ensure that the template is fresh, so, it should:
- Allow complete control and adjustment to your personal taste.
  - You might want to choose between: Retrofit vs. Ktor, Room vs. SQLDelight, Gson vs. kotlin-serialization, Koin vs. Hilt.
- Target the latest Android SDK and implement its features.
  - Example: For Android 16, `AndroidManifest.xml` attribute `android:screenOrientation` values are ignored. If used, they must be updated.
- Have all dependencies up-to-date. (Use [Renovate Bot](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate).)
  - Dependencies get outdated. Then, they must be replaced.
- Consist of code that is constantly and fully updated along with the dependencies.

## My own personal template
If you build lots of Android apps, rolling your own template allows much more freedom than using someone else's template. That's what I did for my personal use.
My template includes:
- **Hand-picked** libraries and code for a 100% Kotlin Compose app. They include:
  - Multi-module Gradle
    - Convention plugins (see: [Convention plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_plugins.html#sec:convention_plugins))
    - Feature-based & layer-based modularization (see: [Guide to Android app modularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16SwTvzDO0A))
    - Version catalogs (see: [Version catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/version_catalogs.html))
  - UI
    - Compose
      - Bill of Materials (BoM)
      - Google Fonts
      - Material 3
  - Other
    - Google OSS Licenses
    - [Renovate Bot](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) (automated dependency management)
- **Optional** commented-out libraries. Added as required for the specific project.
  - May include common libraries, such as Coil, DataStore, Hilt, kotlinx.serialization, OkHttp, Retrofit, etc.

## Conclusion
This article covers why you should create a template, how to find templates using advanced GitHub search, reviews available open-source templates and explains why you should roll your own.
